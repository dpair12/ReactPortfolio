## React-Portfolio

## Project Description

This is a portfolio application that I built from the ground up using react, react-bootsrap, react-dom, and react-router-dom. This application features an about page for myself, a portfolio page to display 6 applications that I created, a contact form, and resume page that allows users to download my resume.

To run the application, download the app to your local machine and enter npm i into the terminal once you have accessed the application via the terminal. From there, just run npm run dev and the application should run. (Note: If application does not automatically open, click on the local host link that gets shown in the terminal)

## Contributing

I am the sole contributor of this project.

## Tests

The only real testing I had to do for this application is getting the contact form to continously check for what the user is inputting and figuring out how to print an error message if the user is not using the form correctly. Also, adding the functionality to download a file as before this project I only knew how to use a tags to get someone to open a document in a new window in-browser.
